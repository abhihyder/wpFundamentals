<!--
By this way we can control every page layout individually. For this we have to create a file.
Just copy the page.php file and rename as custom-template.php. Now add or remove anything from custom-template.php, what we want.
To active the custom template, have to write a name in a php code


Suppose:
-->
<?php
	/*
		Template name: Full width 
	*/
	get_header();?>
