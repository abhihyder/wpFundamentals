<!--
Normally wordpress site control by index.php file. When we open a single post that time we can control site. That means, what will show with the post, suppose we don’t want to show sidebar or menu etc…..
Just copy the index.php file and rename as single.php. Now add or remove anything from single.php, what we want.
