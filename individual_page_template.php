<!--
By this way we can control every page layout individually. For this we have to create a file.
Just copy the page.php file and rename as page-about.php page-10.php. Now add or remove anything from page-about.php or page-10.php, what we want.
[“about” is the page slag and “10” is the id number of that page. ”about and 10” are example]
